## Project Overview

YouBet Task is a platform that automates reward distribution to open-source developers, tracking and recording their contributions to ensure fair and transparent compensation.

Our platform addresses a common issue in the Web3 world: many airdrops are distributed evenly, which is neither fair nor efficient, often requiring extensive manual effort to track contributions. With YouBet Task, contribution tracking and reward distribution are automated, allowing project owners to allocate rewards with precision, even down to individual commits.

And our ultimate goal is to create an environment where developers are free to unleash their creativity. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to make every effort truly worth it.

## Core Features

- Automated and Fair Reward Distribution: Track contributions in the open source community to ensure developers receive fair rewards.
- On-chain Contribution Records and Profiles: Record every effort on the blockchain and create comprehensive developer profiles based on all contributions.
- Simple Task Management Features: Includes contributor rankings, my tasks, claiming and canceling tasks, among other functionalities.
- Collaborative Open Source Tutorials: Facilitate collaboration to create and share open source tutorials, showcasing the value and capabilities of our platform through collective effort.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Nest.js
- Database: MongoDB & Kafka
- EVM chain: Build on Scroll | Compiled and Published by Foundry
